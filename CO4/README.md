# Course Outcome 4 (CO4): 


1. Create a Graphics package that has classes and interfaces for figures Rectangle, Triangle, 
Square and Circle. Test the package by finding the area of these figures. 
2. Create an Arithmetic package that has classes and interfaces for the 4 basic arithmetic 
operations. Test the package by implementing all operations on two given numbers 
3. Write a user defined exception class to authenticate the user name and password. 
4. Find the average of N positive integers, raising a user defined exception for each negative 
input. 
5. Define 2 classes; one for generating multiplication table of 5 and other for displaying first 
N prime numbers. Implement using threads. (Thread class) 
6. Define 2 classes; one for generating Fibonacci numbers and other for displaying even 
numbers in a given range. Implement using threads. (Runnable Interface) 
7. Producer/Consumer using ITC 
8. Program to create a generic stack and do the Push and Pop operations. 
9. Using generic method perform Bubble sort. 
10. Maintain a list of Strings using ArrayList from collection framework, perform built-in 
operations.
11. Program to remove all the elements from a linked list
12. Program to remove an object from the Stack when the position is passed as parameter
13. Program to demonstrate the creation of queue object using the PriorityQueue class
14. Program to demonstrate the addition and deletion of elements in deque
15. Program to demonstrate the creation of Set object using the LinkedHashset class
16. Write a Java program to compare two hash set
17. Program to demonstrate the working of Map interface by adding, changing and removing 
elements.
